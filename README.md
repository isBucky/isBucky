**My name is Matheus, but I go by my nickname — Bucky.**  
**I'm 20 years old and I live in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil 🇧🇷.**

I started programming on my cell phone, literally. Back then, I created simple bots for Discord using nothing but mobile tools. As time went on, those simple bots evolved into more complex systems — all coded entirely on my phone. It was a challenge, but it taught me creativity, patience, and how to optimize code under tight constraints.

Later on, when I got my first computer, a new world opened up. I began building large-scale APIs, full-featured e-commerce platforms, virtual store systems, and integrated payment solutions. With every project, I pushed the boundaries of what I could build — from back-end logic to database design and front-end integration.

Now, with more than 5 years of experience, I’m passionate about building robust, scalable solutions and constantly learning new technologies.
